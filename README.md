This is my new learning on github.
I will only publish or post very much beginner friendly codes and solution to problems which I learn in my university.
No prior experience of using github before,but eager to learn new things.
Currently I am solving problems using C and C++ language.
I am also solving problem on codechef and codeforces which are beginner friendly.
